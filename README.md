Artificial Intelligence Weekly Learning Repository
Overview

This repository contains structured weekly tasks designed to guide learners through the fundamentals and practical applications of Artificial Intelligence. Each week introduces a new AI concept, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on coding exercises to build real, step-by-step knowledge.

The aim of this repository is to develop a strong foundation in AI by progressing from core principles to practical implementation, ensuring both conceptual understanding and technical confidence.

Learning Objectives

Understand fundamental Artificial Intelligence concepts

Apply AI theory through practical coding exercises

Develop problem-solving skills using real-world datasets

Gain experience with common AI and machine learning workflows

Build knowledge progressively through structured weekly learning

How to Use This Repository

Start from Week 01 and progress sequentially

Read the theory material before attempting exercises

Complete coding tasks independently before checking solutions

Experiment with datasets to deepen understanding

Document your learning and observations

Expected Outcomes

By completing all weekly tasks, learners should be able to:

Explain core AI and machine learning concepts

Build and evaluate basic machine learning models

License

This project is intended for educational use. License details can be added depending on distribution requirements.

If you want, I can also:

Make it GitHub portfolio level (stronger wording, more “impressive”)

Tailor it for Fintech / FinScope AI style learning repo

Make it super short (like top-tier open source READMEs)
