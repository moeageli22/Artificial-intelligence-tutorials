## Artificial Intelligence Weekly Learning Repository
## Overview

This repository contains structured weekly tasks designed to guide learners through the fundamentals and practical applications of Artificial Intelligence. Each week introduces a new AI concept, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on coding exercises to build real, step-by-step knowledge.

The aim of this repository is to develop a strong foundation in AI by progressing from core principles to practical implementation, ensuring both conceptual understanding and technical confidence.


## Learning Objectives

1. Understand fundamental Artificial Intelligence concepts

2. Apply AI theory through practical coding exercises

3. Develop problem-solving skills using real-world datasets

4. Gain experience with common AI and machine learning workflows

5. Build knowledge progressively through structured weekly learning
   

## How to Use This Repository

- Start from Week 01 and progress sequentially

- Read the theory material before attempting exercises

- Complete coding tasks independently before checking solutions

- Experiment with datasets to deepen understanding

- Document your learning and observations

- Expected Outcomes

 
## By completing all weekly tasks, learners should be able to:

1. Explain core AI and machine learning concepts

2. Build and evaluate basic machine learning models

3. Work with structured datasets

4. Understand the end-to-end AI workflow from data preparation to evaluation
